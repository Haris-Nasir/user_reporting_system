I have build a single user through postman and functionalities running correctly for the two pages.
I have set Pdf file for the user activity on backend but data needs to be handle on front-end yet.

Technologies Used:-
1. I used postgresql database for storing user and session data.
2. Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication between server and a client.
3. Front-End designed on React and backend designed on node.js for javascript run-time and express framework for handling http-requests.
