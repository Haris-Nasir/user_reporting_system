I have build a single user through postman and functionalities running correctly for the two pages.
I have set Pdf file for the user activity on backend but data needs to be handle on front-end yet.
Technologies Used:-
I used postgresql database for storing user and session data.
Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication between server and a client.
Front-End designed on React and backend designed on node.js for javascript run-time and express framework for handling http-requests.
